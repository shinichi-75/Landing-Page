GARDEN WALK

I love aninme so my Landing Page is related to that. I've tried making my it responsive but some components do not work properly. I'm still learning and will definitely improve in that part. Rest if you want to make changes in my website you are free to do so and be sure to tell meso i can update it.

And I also took inspiration from Criosyom. Here's his/her github page - https://github.com/Criosyom/Hakurei_Shrine.git. More or less the design was same as Criosyom. Sorry Criosyom if you are reading this but I really liked your design so can't help but copied the design only!
